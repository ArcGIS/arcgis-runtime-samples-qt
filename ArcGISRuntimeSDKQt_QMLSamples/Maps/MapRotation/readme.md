#Map rotation

This sample demonstrates how to rotate a map view.
The rotation is set using a slider control, with the rotation
in degrees displayed next to the slider.

## How it works

The slider is initialized to zero degrees and limited to
values from 0 to 360. When the slider
is released, it emits the `pressedChanged` signal.
The rotation is changed by calling the `setViewpoint`
method on the map view. Rotation using two fingers on a
touch screen device is disabled in this sample.

## Tips

This sample code includes a handler for the `pressedChanged`
signal rather than the `valueChanged` signal to avoid
processing the many signals emitted as the slider moves.
Changing the rotation value rapidly interrupts the animated
rotation and may cause animation jitter. Instead, you could
defeat the animation so the rotation tracks the slider value
as it changes by using the method `setViewpointWithAnimationCurve`
with animation duration set to zero seconds.

```
  onValueChanged: {
      var vp = mv.currentViewpoint(Enums.ViewpointTypeCenterAndScale);
      vp.setViewpointRotation(value);
      mv.setViewpointWithAnimationCurve(vp, 0.0, Enums.AnimationCurveLinear);
  }
```
