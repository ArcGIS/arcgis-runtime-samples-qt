<p>This sample demonstrates how to access and add bookmarks to a map.</p>
<p> When the sample starts, the map contains a set of bookmarks. You can select a bookmark from the list, which changes the map's viewpoint. To create a new bookmark, pan and zoom to a new location and select the <code>+</code> button. A prompt appears to let you provide a name for the new bookmark. When you select <code>Done</code> the new bookmark is added to the bookmark list.</p>
