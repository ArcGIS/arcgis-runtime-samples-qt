<p>This sample demonstrates how to determine the map's load status.</p>
<p>The load status is obtained from the <code>loadStatus</code> property. The map is considered 
loaded when any of the following are true: the map has a valid spatial reference, 
the map has an initial viewpoint, or one of the map's predefined layers has been created. 
A signal handler is set up on the map to handle the <code>loadStatusChanged</code> signal by 
updating the text at the bottom of the display with the new load status.</p>
