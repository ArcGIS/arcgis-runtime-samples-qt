## How it works
Create a `ServiceFeatureTable` from a web service. Set the `ServiceFeatureTable` to a `FeatureLayer` and set the rendering mode to `Enums.FeatureRenderingModeDynamic`. When definining the FeatureLayer's `Renderer`, remember to set the extrusion mode on the `SceneProperties`. Finally, also on `SceneProperties`, use set the extrusion expression to (`"[SOME_FIELD]"`) to a `Field` from the `ServiceFeatureTable`.
