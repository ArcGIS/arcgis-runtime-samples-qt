<p>This sample demonstrates how to display a tiled map service.
An <code>ArcGISTiledLayer</code> is created by setting its <code>url</code> property to 
the URL of the map service endpoint. The <code>ArcGISTiledLayer</code> is nested within a 
basemap, thus becoming one of the basemap's layers. The basemap is set as the basemap of 
the map, and the map is set as the map for the map view. Note how default properties in 
QML make this nesting easier to code.</p>
