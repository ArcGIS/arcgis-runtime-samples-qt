# Hillshade renderer

This sample shows how to apply a HillshadeRenderer to a RasterLayer. A hillshade, also known as shaded relief, is a grayscale representation of a 3D surface, with the sun's relative position taken into account for shading the image.

## How it works
A `Raster` is constructed from the local raster file. The `Raster` is then used to construct a `RasterLayer`, which is then added to a `Map`. Finally `HillshadeRenderer` is created, several of the properties are set (azimuth, angle, and so on), and the renderer is set on the `RasterLayer`. You can modify the look of the `HillshadeRenderer` by pressing the Edit Renderer button, and changing the azimuth, angle, and slope type. Each time the apply button is clicked, a new `HillshadeRenderer` is created and set on the `RasterLayer`.
