<p>This sample demonstrates how to use a vector tiled layer from an ArcGIS Online service 
as a basemap.

When a new item is selected from the combo box, a JavaScript function that determines the 
currently selected vector tiled layer basemap is executed. The map's basemap is replaced 
by setting basemap property to the desired basemap. If there were operational layers 
present in the map, this would have no effect on them.
