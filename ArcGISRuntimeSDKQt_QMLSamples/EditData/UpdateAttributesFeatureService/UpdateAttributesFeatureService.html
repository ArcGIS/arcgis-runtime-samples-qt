<p>This sample demonstrates how to edit attributes of feature in a feature service.
Features in the map represent damage inspection points and are symbolized based on an 
attribute specifying the type of damage. Selecting an inspection point displays a callout. 
The callout contains information about the type of damage. To change the type of damage, 
select the <code>information</code> button in the callout. An editing window appears, 
allowing you to choose new attribute values. Selecting the <code>update</code> button will 
update the inspection point with the new value.</p>
