<p>The sample demonstrates how to add, delete, and fetch attachments for a specific feature in a feature service.
Click or tap on a feature to show its callout. The callout specifies the number of attachments for that particular feature. Selecting on the <code>info</code> button inside the callout shows the list of those attachments. In the list you can add a new attachment by selecting the <code>+</code> button. You can delete an attachment by selecting an attachment and selecting the <code>-</code> button. </p>
