## How it works
This sample demonstrates how to use a `UniqueValueRenderer` to style different features in a `FeatureLayer`. Using the `UniqueValueRenderer` allows for seperate symbols to be used for features that have a specific value in a certain field. In this case, the field is state abbreviations in the USA. Multiple fields can be used; this sample only uses one.
