This sample demonstrates how to create a `SimpleRenderer` and add it to a `GraphicsOverlay`.

##How it works
A `GraphicsOverlay` is added to the `MapView`. A `SimpleRenderer` is created in the `GraphicsOverlay` which sets a red cross `SimpleMarkerSymbol` as its symbol. Three `Graphic`s are added using `Point`s.
