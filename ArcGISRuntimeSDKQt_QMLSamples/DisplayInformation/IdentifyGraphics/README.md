# Identify graphics

This sample demonstrates how to identify graphics in a graphics overlay.

## How it works

When you select a graphic on the map, a message box appears. This is accomplished by first setting up a signal handler for the `mouseClicked` signal on the `MapView`. Once this signal is emitted, call `identifyGraphicsOverlay` on the `MapView`, and pass in the `GraphicsOverlay` to identify on, the mouse coordinates, the tolerance, and the max features. Finally, set up a signal handler on the `MapView` to handle the `identifyGraphicsOverlayStatusChanged` signal. Once the signal emits and the `identifyGraphicsOverlayStatus` is completed, the `identifyGraphicsOverlayResults` will be hydrated with any of the graphics that were identified. If the length of this list of graphics is greater than 0, show the message dialog that indicates a graphic has been identified.
