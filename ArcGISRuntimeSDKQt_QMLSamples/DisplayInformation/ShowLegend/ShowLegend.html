<p>This sample demonstrates how to show a legend for all the operational layers in the map.
The sample utilizes the <code>autoFetchLegendInfos</code> property on the Map. This 
property will cause the map to recursively loop through all of the operational layers in 
the map (including sublayers), and request the <code>LegendInfo</code> for each item. All 
of the resulting LegendInfo objects are passed into the LegendInfoListModel. A QML 
ListView directly consumes this model, and separates each item by using a 
<code>section</code>.</p>
