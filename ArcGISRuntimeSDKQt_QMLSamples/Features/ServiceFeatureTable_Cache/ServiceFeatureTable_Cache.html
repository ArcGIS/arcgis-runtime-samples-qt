<p>This sample demonstrates how to use a feature table with the <code>
OnInteractionCache</code> feature request mode. This mode will cache features 
locally from the remote feature service. This is the default mode, and will 
minimize the amount of requests sent to the server, thus lending itself to be 
the ideal choice for working in a partially connected environment.</p>
