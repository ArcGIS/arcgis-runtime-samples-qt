<p>This sample demonstrates how to select features in a feature layer. Click or tap on an area of the map where you see features to select features. This will execute an <code>identifyLayer</code> operation on the map view. When the operation completes, the <code>identifyLayerStatusChanged</code> signal emits, and a list of features is returned. Call the <code>selectFeatures</code> method on the feature layer, passing in the list of features. This will select the features and highlight them on the map view.</p>
