# Add items to Portal

This sample demonstrates how to add and delete items (in this case a local .csv file) in a user's portal.

## How it works
1. A `Portal` is created with a `Credential` using `OAuthModeUser`.
2. A `PortalItem` of type CSV is created using this portal.
3. When the "Autheticate" button is clicked, the portal is loaded and the `AuthenticationView` is displayed to request credentials.
4. When the portal is successfully loaded, the `PortalUser` object is obtained from the portal.
5. When the "Add Item" button is clicked, the item is added via the portalUser's `addPortalItemWithUrl` method. The portalItem and the local Url of the CSV file are supplied as parameters.
6. When the item has been succesfully added, it is loaded in order to retrieve online properties such as the `itemId`.'
7. When the "Delete Item" button is clicked, the item is passed as a parameter for the portalUser's `deleteItem` method.
