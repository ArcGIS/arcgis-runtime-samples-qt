# Find a place

This sample demonstrates how to use geocode functionality to search for points of interest around a location or within an extent.

## How it works
Two text boxes allow you to input a point of interest (such as "Movie Theater", "Starbucks", or "Park"), as well as a location. Setting a location will set the preferred search location, so that geocode results closer to that location are preferred. Optionally, tap the pin symbol in the text box to search near your current location. When you pan the map and change the current viewpoint, a button will appear, allowing you to search the current map extent for a place of interest.

This workflow is accomplished by creating a `LocatorTask` with the URL to the World Geocoding Service. Suggestions are obtained by binding the locator's suggestion `searchText` to the text boxes. Binding this property to the text box results in suggestions being fetched automatically whenever this searchText changes. "POI" and "Populated Place" categories are set on the `SuggestionParameters` so that the suggestions for each text box make sense. Once a suggestion is selected or enter is hit on the keyboard, `geocodeWithParameters` is called. The `GeocodeParameters` sets the `preferredSearchLocation`, so that results near this location are preferred. If the button to search within an extent is clicked, the `searchArea` property is set to the MapView's current viewpoint. Search area differs from preferred search location because it only shows results within the search area, whereas the preferred search area only prefers closer results over further results. Once the geocode completes successfully, a `Graphic` is created for each `GeocodeResult`, and is added to a `GraphicsOverlay` for display on the Map.
