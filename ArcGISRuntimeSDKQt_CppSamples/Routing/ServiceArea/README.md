# Service Area

Demonstrates how to find services areas around a point using the ServiceAreaTask.
A service area shows locations that can be reached from a facility based off a certain impedance [such as travel time].
Barriers can also be added which can affect the impedance by not letting traffic through or adding the time is takes to pass that barrier.

## How to use sample

- In order to find any services areas at least one `ServiceAreaFaciltiy` needs to be added.
- To add a facility, click the Facility button then click anywhere on the `MapView`.
- To add a barrier, click the Barrier button and click multiple locations on sMapViews to draw a barrier.
- To start a new line in a distinct location, click "new barrier"
- To show service areas around facilities that were added, click Service Area button.
- The Reset button, clears all graphics and resets the `ServiceAreaTask`.

## How it works

To display service areas around a certain location:

- Create a `ServiceAreaTask` from an online service.
- Get a `ServiceAreaParameters` from the task using `ServiceAreaTask::createDefaultParameters`
- Set a spatial reference for the parameters using `ServiceAreaParameters::setOutputSpatialReference`. This will allow any geometry that is returned to be displayed on the `MapView`.
- Set the parameters to return polygons, which will return any service area that needs to be displayed.
- Add a `ServiceAreaFacilty` to parameters, `ServiceAreaParameters::setFacilities`
- Optionally add `PolylineBarriers` to parameters, `ServiceAreaParameters::setPolylineBarriers`
- Get the `ServiceAreaResult` by solving the service area task using the parameters, `ServiceAreaTask.solveServiceArea`
- Get any `ServiceAreaPolygons` that were returned using `ServiceAreaResult::resultPolygons`
- facilityIndex is the faciltiy from the `MapView` that you want to get the services areas of.
- Display service areas to `MapView` by creating graphics for their geometry and adding to a graphics overlay.
