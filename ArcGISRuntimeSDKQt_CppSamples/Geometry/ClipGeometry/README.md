# Clip geometry

This sample demonstrates how to clip a geometry with an envelope using the GeometryEngine.

## How to use the sample
Click or tap the 'Clip' button to display the clipping results of the blue graphic and the red outlines.


## How it works
1. Create a `GraphicsOverlay` and add a `Graphic` containing an envelope.
2. Create another `GraphicsOverlay` that contains three other envelopes: one that intersects a part of the first graphic, one that is entirely within it, and another completely outside of it.
3. Create a third `GraphicsOverlay` but add no graphics to it.
4. Create a Button that, when clicked, calls a function that hides the main graphic. In the same function, iterate through the `GraphicsOverlay` that contains the three envelopes and call `GeometryEngine::clip` for each `Envelope`, by passing in the main graphic's `Geometry` and the current `Envelope` as arguments.
5. Add each clipped `Geometry` graphic to the empty `GraphicsOverlay` to visualize the clipped geometries.
