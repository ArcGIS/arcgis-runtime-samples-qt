<p>This sample demonstrates how to display a tiled map service.
An <code>ArcGISTiledLayer</code> is constructed by passing in the URL to the map service 
endpoint. Next, a <code>Basemap</code> is created, and the <code>ArcGISTiledLayer</code> 
is appended to the <code>baseLayers</code> of the <code>Basemap</code>. Finally, the 
<code>Map</code> is constructed with the <code>Basemap</code>, and is set to the 
<code>MapView</code>.</p>
