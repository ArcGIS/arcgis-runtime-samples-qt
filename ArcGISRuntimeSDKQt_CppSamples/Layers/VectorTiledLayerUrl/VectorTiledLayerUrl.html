<p>This sample demonstrates how to use a vector tiled layer from an ArcGIS Online service as a basemap. When a new item is selected from the combo box, an invokable C++ function that determines the currently selected vector tiled layer basemap is executed. The map's basemap is replaced by simply calling its <code>setBasemap</code> method, passing in the desired basemap.</p>
