#Hillshade renderer

This sample shows how to apply a HillshadeRenderer to a RasterLayer.

##How it works
A `Raster` is constructed from the local raster file. The `Raster` is then used to construct a `RasterLayer`, which is then added to a `Map`. Finally `HillshadeRenderer` is created, several of the properties are set (azimuth, angle, and so on), and the renderer is set on the `RasterLayer`
