# Raster layer (file)

Demonstrates how to create and use a raster layer made from a local raster file.

## How to use the sample
- The sample will load with a map showing a basemap and a loaded raster layer.
- Tap on the "Add Raster" button to browse for a new raster file.
- On desktop platforms the sample also allows you to drag and drop supported raster files to load.

## How it works
To add a `RasterLayer` as an operational layer from a local raster file:

- Create a `Map` with a `Basemap`. Once this has been loaded, raster layers will be re-projected on the fly to match the map.
- Create a `Raster` from a raster file.
- Create a `RasterLayer` from the raster.
- Add it as an operational layer with `m_map->operationalLayers->append(rasterLayer)`.
- Once the raster layer has been successfully loaded, zoom the map view to an appropriate extent to see it.
