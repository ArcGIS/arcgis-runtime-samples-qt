# Raster layer (GeoPackage)

This sample demonstrates how to open a GeoPackage, obtain a raster from the package, and display the table as a RasterLayer.

## How it works
A GeoPackage is created by passing the path to a `.gpkg` file. Once the `Map` loads, `GeoPackage::load` is called. A signal handler is connected so that once the `GeoPackage` loads, the `RasterLayer` can be created. The `RasterLayer` is created by obtaining the first `Raster` in the list of `GeoPackageRasters`, and passing that `Raster` to the `RasterLayer`. Finally, the new layer is appended to the Map's operational layers.
