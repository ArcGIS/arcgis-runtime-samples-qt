##How it works
WebTiledLayer provides a simple way to integrate non-ArcGIS Services as a layer in a map. In this case, map tiles from Stamen are added to the map. The template URL is specified by setting the subDomains, level, col, and row attributes. Additionally, copyright information is added to the layer so that the layer can be properly attributed. The layer is added to a Basemap, and a Basemap is added to a Map. Finally, the Map is set on the MapView, and the tiled layer is displayed.
