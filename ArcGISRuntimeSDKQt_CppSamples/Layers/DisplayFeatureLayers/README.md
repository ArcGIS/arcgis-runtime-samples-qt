# Display feature layers

Display feature layers from various data sources.

## Use case

Feature layers, like all layers, are visual representations of data and are used on a map or scene. In the case of feature layers, the underlying data is held in a feature table or feature service.

Feature services are useful for sharing vector GIS data with clients so that individual features can be queried, displayed, and edited. There are various online and offline methods to load feature services.

## How to use the sample

Use the drop down to display different feature layers on the map. Pan and zoom the map to view the feature layers.

## How it works

1. Set the basemap with a `BasemapStyle` enum
2. Create a feature layer with a `Geodatabase`
    - Instantiate a `Geodatabase` using the file name
    - Get a `GeodatabaseFeatureTable` by name from the geodatabase
    - Create a new `FeatureLayer` from the feature table
3. Create a feature layer with a `GeoPackage`
    - Instantiate a `GeoPackage` using the file name and load it
    - Get the first `GeoPackageFeatureTable` from the geopackage's feature tables list
    - Create a new `FeatureLayer` from the feature table
4. Create a feature layer with a `PortalItem`
    - Instantiate a `PortalItem` with a `Portal` and an item ID
    - Create a `FeatureLayer` with the portal item and layer ID
5. Create a feature layer with a `ServiceFeatureTable`
    - Create a `ServiceFeatureTable` with a url
    - Create a `FeatureLayer` with the feature table
6. Create a feature layer with a shapefile
    - Create a `ShapefileFeatureTable` using the shapefile name
    - Create a feature layer from the feature table and load it
7. Add the created feature layer to the `Map`'s `operationalLayers`
