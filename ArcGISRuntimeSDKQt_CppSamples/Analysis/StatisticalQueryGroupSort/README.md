# Statistical query (group & sort)

This sample demonstrates how to query a feature table to get statistics for one or more specified fields. The sample queries a service feature table of US states to get the selected statistics. The results can be grouped and sorted using one or several fields in the table.

## How it works
A `ServiceFeatureTable` is created with the `URL` to the REST endpoing of a feature service. `StatisticQueryParameters` are created, and the `statisticDefinitions` list, `groupByFieldNames` list, and the `orderByFields` list are set on the parameters, matching the options selected in the UI. Next, `queryStatistics()` is executed on the `ServiceFeatureTable`. A lambda connection is made for the `queryStatisticsCompleted` signal, and once this signal emits, the `StatisticQueryResult` is obtained and displayed in the UI.

## Instructions
- Select a combination of fields and statistic types to include in the query.
- (Optional) Choose one or more fields to group the results on. Grouping by SUB_REGION, for example, will show results grouped (summarized) for each region ('Pacific', 'Mountain', etc).
- (Optional) Choose one or more fields to order results by. Only those fields selected for grouping are valid choices for ordering results.
- Execute the query. Results will be displayed in a hierarchical view that is grouped and sorted according to the chosen fields.
