# Line of Sight (location)

This sample demonstrates how to perform a line of sight analysis between two points in a SceneView.

## How it works
A `LineOfSight` analysis is a type of visual analysis you can perform on a scene. The `LineOfSight` analysis aims to answer the question 'What are the visible and obstructed portions of a line between two locations?'. The output is a line in an overlay with two different colors - one representing the visible areas and the other representing the obstructed areas.

This is achieved by first creating a `LocationLineOfSight`, and assigning values for the `observerLocation` and `targetLocation`. Once the `LineOfSight` is created, it is added to an AnalysisOverlay, which is then added to the SceneView. Each time the screen is tapped, the LineOfSight's `targetLocation` is updated with the clicked point, and the `LineOfSight` is automatically recalculated and displayed in the overlay.
