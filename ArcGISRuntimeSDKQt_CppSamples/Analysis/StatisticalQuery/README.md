# Statistical query

This sample demonstrates how to query a table to get aggregated statistics back for a specific field.

## How it works
A `ServiceFeatureTable` is created with a URL to the REST endpoint of a feature service. `StatisticsQueryParameters` are created, and several `StatisticDefinition` objects are created and added to the parameters. These definitions define the various statistics that we would like to compute, such as average, minimum, and maximum of a given field. When the button is clicked, `queryStatistics` is executed on the `ServiceFeatureTable`. Depending on the state of two checkboxes, additional paramters are set. This process runs asynchronously, and once complete, this gives access to the `QueryStatisticsResult`, which contains key/value pairs as the result.
