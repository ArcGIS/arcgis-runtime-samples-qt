# Terrain Exaggeration
This sample demonstrates how to exaggerate a scene's terrain surface.

## How to use the sample
Click and drag the slider at the bottom to change how exaggerated the terrain becomes.

## How it works
1. Create a scene and add a slider (with an ID) to the UI via QML.
2. Create a new function for this called `setExaggerationElevation` that accepts a `double` argument.
3. Check that m_surface exists using an `if` statement; if this check does not happen, it's possible that the function runs before the scene is even created.
4. If `m_surface` exists, then access its `setElevationExaggeration` method and pass in the `double` parameter.
5. In the `.qml` file, ensure that the main sample object at the root of the QML heirarchy has an ID for reference.
6. Connect to the QML Slider's `OnValueChanged` signal handler.
7. Call the `setElevationExaggeration` method of your root object.
