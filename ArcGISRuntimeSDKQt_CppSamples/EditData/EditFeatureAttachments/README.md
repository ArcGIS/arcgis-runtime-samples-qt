#Edit feature attachments

The sample demonstrates how to add, delete, and fetch attachments for a specific feature in a feature service.

##How it works

Click or tap on a feature to show its callout. The callout specifies the number of attachments for that particular feature. Selecting on the `info` button inside the callout shows the list of those attachments. In the list you can add a new attachment by selecting the `+` button. You can delete an attachment by selecting an attachment and selecting the `-` button. This is all controlled through the attachment list model, which is obtained through the feature. The attachment list model works similarly to other QML models, and can be directly fed into a list view for easy display and user interaction. 

To work with this C++ class in QML, you must create a `Q_PROPERTY` in C++, and register the class as a QML type. Once this is done, the model will be accessible from QML. 
To populate the model, obtain the selected feature and set a member variable equal to the selected feature's `AttachmentListModel`. Emit a signal indicating that this has been updated, and QML property binding will detect the change and display the new model in the view. 

To edit the attachments, call `addAttachment` or `deleteAttachment` on the `AttachmentListModel`. By default, edits are automatically applied to the service and `applyEdits` does not need to be called.
