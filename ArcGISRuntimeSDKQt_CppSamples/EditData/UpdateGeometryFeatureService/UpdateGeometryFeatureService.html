<p>The sample demonstrates how to update geometry of a feature in a feature 
service.</p> <p>Selecting a feature on the map selects and highlights the 
feature. Selecting another location on the map moves the feature to the new 
location. This is done by first obtaining the feature after it is selected. 
Once the feature is obtained, the feature's geometry is updated by setting 
the geometry to the new map point. To update the feature in the feature 
table, call <code>updateFeature</code> and pass in the edited feature. 
Finally, to update the feature in the service, call <code>applyEdits</code>.
