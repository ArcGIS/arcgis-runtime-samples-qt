<p>This sample demonstrates how to delete a feature from a feature service.
Clicking or tapping on a feature displays a callout for it. To delete that feature from 
the feature service, select the <code>delete</code> button in the callout. This button 
will invoke the <code>deleteFeature</code> method on the feature table, deleting the 
feature from the local table. Then the <code>applyEdits</code> method is called to apply 
the edits to the service, deleting the feature from the service.</p>
