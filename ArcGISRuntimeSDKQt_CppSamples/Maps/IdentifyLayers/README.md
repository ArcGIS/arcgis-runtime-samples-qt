# Identify layers

This sample demonstrates how to identify features on a map across the different layers in the map.

## How it works
The `GeoView::identifyLayers` method is executed by passing in the screen coordinates of a mouse click, along with a tolerance and whether to return popups. The `identifyLayers` method differs from the `identifyLayer` method because it performs an identify on every layer in the map or scene - not just one layer. Since the process is executed for several different layers, a list of `IdentifyLayerResult` is returned. This particular example has a map with a `FeatureLayer` and an `ArcGISMapImageLayer` in the operational layer list. A `FeatureLayer` will have all returned GeoElements available at the root level, but the `ArcGISMapImageLayer` could contain sublayers, each of which could contain additional sublayers. Because of this, a depth first search is used to find the number of results in the sublayers. The layer name and the total count is displayed in a Message Dialog.
