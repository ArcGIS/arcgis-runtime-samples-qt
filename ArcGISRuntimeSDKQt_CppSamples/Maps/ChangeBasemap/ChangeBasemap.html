<p>This sample demonstrates how to change a map's basemap.</p>
<p>When a new item is selected from the combo box, an invokable C++ function 
that determines the currently selected basemap is executed. The map's basemap 
is replaced by simply calling its <code>setBasemap</code> method, and passing in the 
desired basemap. If there were operational layers present in the map, this 
would have no effect on them.</p>
