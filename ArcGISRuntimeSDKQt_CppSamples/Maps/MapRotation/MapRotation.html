<p>This sample demonstrates how to rotate a map view.
The rotation is set using a slider control, with the rotation
in degrees displayed next to the slider. The slider is initialized to zero degrees and limited to
values from 0 to 360. When the slider
is released, it emits the <code>pressedChanged</code> signal.
The rotation is changed by calling the <code>setViewpoint</code>
method on the map view. Rotation using two fingers on a
touch screen device is disabled in this sample.</p>
