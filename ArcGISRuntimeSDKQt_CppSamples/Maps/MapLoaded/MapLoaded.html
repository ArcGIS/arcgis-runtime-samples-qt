<p>This sample demonstrates how to determine the map's load status. The load status is obtained from the <code>loadStatus</code> property, which is inherited from the loadable interface. The map will be considered loaded when any of the following are true: the map has a valid spatial reference, the map has an initial viewpoint, or one of the map's predefined layers has been created. A lambda is set up on the map to handle the <code>loadStatusChanged</code> signal by updating the text at the bottom of the display with the new load status.</p>
