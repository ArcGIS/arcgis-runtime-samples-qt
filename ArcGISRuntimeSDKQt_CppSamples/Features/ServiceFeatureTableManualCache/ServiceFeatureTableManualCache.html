<p>This sample demonstrates how to use a feature service in manual cache mode. 
In this mode, an app explicitly requests features as needed from the remote 
service.
The sample creates a service feature table by supplying the URL to the REST 
endpoint of the feature service, and set the caching mode to manual. It 
creates a new feature layer that uses the service feature table, and adds the 
feature layer to the map. When the <code>Populate</code> button is pressed, the sample 
calls the <code>populateFromService</code> method on the feature layer to fetch new 
features from the service, which are automatically added to the map.</p>
