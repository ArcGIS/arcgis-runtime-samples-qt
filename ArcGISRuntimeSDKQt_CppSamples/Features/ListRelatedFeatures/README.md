# List related features

This sample demonstrates how to query a layer for features that are in a related table.

## How it works
A `Map` is constructed by passing a URL to a web map stored in ArcGIS Online. A connection is made to the `mouseClicked` signal of the `MapView`, and when this signal emits, `selectFeatures` is executed on the `FeatureLayer`. Once this completes, a `FeatureQueryResult` is returned, giving access to the `FeatureIterator`. This `FeatureIterator` contains all of the `Feature` objects selected with the mouse click. These `Feature` objects are iterated over, and for each object, the `queryRelatedFeatures` method is called. Once this completes, the returned `RelatedFeatureQueryResult` gives access to all of the related features, and the UI is populated with this information.
