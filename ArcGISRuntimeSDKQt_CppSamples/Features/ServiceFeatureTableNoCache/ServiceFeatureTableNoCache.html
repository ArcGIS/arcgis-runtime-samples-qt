<p>This sample demonstrates how to use a feature table in on interaction no cache mode. In 
this mode, an app requests features from the remote service and does not cache them. This 
means that new features are requested from the service each time the viewpoint's visible 
extent changes.
The sample creates an instance of <code>ServiceFeatureTable</code> by supplying the URL to 
the REST endpoint of the feature service. The feature layer is then supplied with the 
<code>ServiceFeatureTable</code> and added to the map. Finally, the OnInteractionNoCache 
feature request mode is set.</p>
