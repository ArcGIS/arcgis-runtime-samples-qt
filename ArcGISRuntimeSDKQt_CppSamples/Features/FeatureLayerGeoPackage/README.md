# Feature layer (GeoPackage)

This sample demonstrates how to open a GeoPackage, obtain a feature table from the package, and display the table as a FeatureLayer.

## How it works
A GeoPackage is created by passing the path to a `.gpkg` file. Once the `Map` loads, `GeoPackage::load` is called. A signal handler is connected so that once the `GeoPackage` loads, the `FeatureLayer` can be created. The `FeatureLayer` is created by obtaining the first table in the list of `GeoPackageFeatureTables`, and passing that feature table to the `FeatureLayer`. Finally, the new layer is appended to the Map's operational layers.
