# Dynamic workspace shapefile

This sample demonstrates how to dynamically add a shapefile to a map using the Local Server.

## How it works
A `LocalMapService` is created using a blank MPK. Next, a `ShapefileWorkspace` is created for the selected folder, and a `TableSublayerSource` is created from the shapefile workspace and the file name. Then, the shapefile workspace is added to the local service's dynamic workspaces, by calling `setDynamicWorkspaces`. Once the workspaces are set, the local map service is started. Once the service starts successfully, an `ArcGISMapImageSublayer` is created from the `RasterSublayerSource`, the sublayer is added to a new `ArcGISMapImageLayer`, a default renderer is applied to the sublayer, and the image layer is added to the `Map`.
