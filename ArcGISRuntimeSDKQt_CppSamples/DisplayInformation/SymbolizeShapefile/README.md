# Symbolize a shapefile

This sample demonstrates how to override the default renderer of a shapefile when displaying with a FeatureLayer.

## How it works
A `ShapefileFeatureTable` is created by setting the path to a shapefile. The shapefile is then displayed by creating a `FeatureLayer` and setting the feature table property to the `ShapefileFeatureTable`. This layer is added to a `Map` and the default black and gray symbology is applied. To override the default symbology, a `SimpleRenderer` is created. A `SimpleRenderer` is used to apply the same symbol to every feature. In this case, a yellow `SimpleFillSymbol` with a red `SimpleLineSymbol` as an outline is used. The renderer is set on the `FeatureLayer`, and the layer's symbology updates.
