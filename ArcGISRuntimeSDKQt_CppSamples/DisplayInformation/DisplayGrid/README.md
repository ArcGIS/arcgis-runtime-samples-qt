# Display a grid

This sample demonstrates how to display grids such as MGRS, Lat/Lon, USNG, and UTM on a map. In addition, this sample demonstrates how to configure the look and feel of the grid.

## How it works
A `MapView` is declared with a `Map` that contains the imagery basemap. The `MapView` is initially set to use the Latitude/Longitude map grid by setting the `MapView::setGrid` method. Press the button on the bottom to display a settings window, which has several controls that modify the grid. Modifications to the grid include the grid type (MGRS, Lat/Lon, USNG, and UTM), label visibility, grid visibility, label color, grid color, label position, and label format.
