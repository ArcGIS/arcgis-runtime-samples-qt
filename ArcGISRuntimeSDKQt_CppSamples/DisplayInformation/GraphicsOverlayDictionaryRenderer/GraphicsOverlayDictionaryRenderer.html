<p>This sample demonstrates applying a dictionary renderer to graphics to display military symbology.
This sample loads a number of point, line, and polygon military elements from an XML file 
and adds them as graphics to a <code>GraphicsOverlay</code>. A 
<code>DictionaryRenderer</code> is applied to the <code>GraphicsOverlay</code> in order to 
display the graphics with MIL-STD-2525D military symbology. When all graphics are created, 
the map's viewpoint is set to zoom to the full extent of all graphics.</p>
